This game is a sort of expansion to a project I did my freshman year
at GVSU. 

The premise of the game was about GVSU being threatened by an evil elf that had stationed itself in the forest. The game was created in Python and was text-based. We had to create various items, connect different parts of the map, and explore a way (of our choosing, the programmers) to defeat the evil elf.

How this expands on that initial project is by creating a top-down game that is hosted via Google Cloud, making it accessible to other people.

One path that I'd like to take with this in the future might be to take it off the Cloud, and make it an executable that people can play offline. I would change the languages used (Python, C++, C#, Java, etc...) and create an actual executable game. To challenge myself, once I have the game in a state I'm happy with, I would like to create the game using assembly and/or C, like how the older, top-down games used to be made like from Nintendo

Another path to take could be to make the game 3D. It doesn't have to be anything fancy. I really like the idea of making it have graphics like the N64. I could make the game in C and Assembly if we want some basic things (movings around, collisions, math stoof). This would be a later endeavor. I might start like the previous path (using more higher level languages with libraries)
