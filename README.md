This game is a sort of expansion to a project I did my freshman year
at GVSU. 

The premise of the game was about GVSU being threatened by an evil elf that had stationed itself in the forest. The game was created in Python and was text-based. We had to create various items, connect different parts of the map, and explore a way (of our choosing, the programmers) to defeat the evil elf.

How this expands on that initial project is by creating a top-down game that is hosted via Google Cloud, making it accessible to other people.
